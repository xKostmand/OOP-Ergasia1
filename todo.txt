Clean up (Better file arrangement,function calls)
Presentation

Bugs Left:
    Potion collisions(other entities shouldnt pass throw it)
    Maybe dont load AOE_Heal.wav twice(maybe load it at the start only once)
    Add Avatar PotionCount into pause menu
    Maybe avatar "speed" should be lower
    I can press H to heal my team infinite times after picking up the potion

Bugs Fixed:
    Dead entities no longer go bottom right
    Fixed Restart option with wrong entity count
    Potion spawning while there is a collision
    Maybe Potion position should only be in the middle part
